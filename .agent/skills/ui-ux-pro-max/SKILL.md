# UI UX Pro Max

(Sourced from: https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill)

## Features & Capabilities
This skill provides access to the `src/` directory which contains:
- **Design Systems**: Rules for generating comprehensive design schemas.
- **Palettes**: Industry-specific color systems.
- **Components**: Best practice patterns for React/Tailwind.

## How to used
The agent should refer to the files in `src/` for specific implementation details when requested.

**For example:**
- If user asks for "SaaS Dashboard", look at `src/palettes/saas.json` (hypothetical) or relevant guidelines in `README.md`.
- Follow the **Reasoning Rules** defined in the repository's documentation.

## Core Principles (from README)
1.  **Visual Excellence**: Good enough is NOT enough.
2.  **Accessibility**: First-class citizen.
3.  **Interaction**: Every element must respond to user input.
