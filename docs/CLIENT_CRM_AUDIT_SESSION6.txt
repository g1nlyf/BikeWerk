## 1. CLIENT JOURNEY (DMITRY)

### 1️⃣ Homepage & First Impressions
**Actions:**
- Browsed homepage. Checked navigation, trust elements, and design.

**Report:**
✅ **Good Points:**
- **Visuals:** Modern, clean design. "Bike from Europe in 2 clicks" value prop is clear.
- **Performance:** Initial load is fast.
- **Trust:** Footer looks professional (though links need verification).

⚠️ **Scare Factors (UX/Trust Issues):**
1.  **Broken Calculator**: The "Delivery Calculator" is stuck on "Waiting for data..." (Likely port 8082 unreachable). A broken core tool immediately kills trust.
2.  **Product Links 403**: Clicking "Details" on featured bikes often leads to a "Product not found" error (likely API permission/403 issue).
3.  **Generic Content**: "How we started" sections feel like placeholder text.

### 2️⃣ Booking Flow (Alternative Path)
**Actions:**
-   Since Catalog Search was broken, navigated via "Show buyback conditions" / Direct URL.
-   Found booking form at `/booking-checkout/3`.

**Report:**
✅ **Good Points:**
-   **Form Simplicity**: Only essential fields (Name, Phone, City, Comment).
-   **Immediate Feedback**: Success message appeared instantly.
-   **Credentials**: System auto-generated login (Phone) and Password, which is great for new users.

⚠️ **Issues:**
-   **Hidden Path**: I had to dig to find a working booking form because the main product pages were erroring out. A real client might have left.

### 3️⃣ Submission Data
-   **Order ID**: `ORD-944035`
-   **Customer**: Dmitry (+7 999 123-45-67)
-   **Bike**: YT Capra Shred (ID: 3)
-   **Status**: Submitted successfully.

## 2. BACKEND DATA VERIFICATION
*Attempted verification via script, but proceeding with CRM UI verification.*

## 3. CRM MANAGER FLOW (ALEXEY)

### 1️⃣ Dashboard & Order Visibility
**Actions:**
-   Logged in as `crm.manager@local`.
-   Checked Dashboard for new order.

**Report:**
✅ **Success:**
-   Dashboard loaded correctly.
-   Metric "Total Orders" reflects the system state.

### 2️⃣ Order Processing (ORD-944035)
**Actions:**
-   Found Order `ORD-944035` for Dmitry.
-   Verified Details: Name (Dmitry), Phone (+7 999 123-45-67), Bike (YT Capra Shred), Amount (~2069 EUR).
-   **Action**: Assigned to "CRM Manager" (Alexey).
-   **Action**: Changed Status to "Reserve Paid".

**Report:**
✅ **Data Integrity:**
-   The data submitted by the client (Dmitry) matches EXACTLY what the Manager sees. No data loss.

⚠️ **Critical Issues (Backend):**
-   **errors during update**: When saving the status/manager, the browser console reported **400 Bad Request** and **503 Service Unavailable**.
-   **UI Optimistic Update**: The UI *showed* the changes (Status: Reserve Paid), but given the errors, there is a high risk these changes **DID NOT PERSIST** to the database.

## 4. FINAL VERIFICATION & VERDICT

### 4.1 Data Persistence Check
-   **Status**: The UI shows "Reserve Paid", but the backend threw 400/503.
-   **Risk**: High probability of data inconsistency.

### 4.2 Final Verdict
-   **Frontend Conversion**: **Medium**. The calculator and broken links are conversion killers, but the booking form itself is smooth.
-   **Backend Stability**: **Low**. 400/503 errors during basic CRM operations are unacceptable for production.
-   **End-to-End Flow**: **Functional but Fragile**. The client can submit, and the manager can *see* it, but processing it is buggy.

**Recommendations:**
1.  **Fix Calculator Backend**: Ensure port 8082 service is running and accessible.
2.  **Investigate CRM API Errors**: The 400/503 on `PUT /api/orders` need immediate debugging.
3.  **Fix Product Details 403**: Ensure public access to bike details is correctly configured in Supabase policies.
