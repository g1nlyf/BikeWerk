Consequence: "Awaiting Manager" metric is 0 (likely incorrect) and the list might be empty.
BUG: Urgent Tasks display "URL: undefined" in their descriptions (e.g., "Verify bike... URL: undefined").
💡 Suggestions:

Fix the 500 error immediately to see new orders.
Fix the URL generation for tasks.

💡 Suggestions:

Fix status filter backend handler.

Search with non-ASCII characters (Cyrillic) had tooling issues (might work for real user, but unverified).

Fix the click handler for table rows immediately.

Context: http://localhost:5175/crm/leads

Findings: ✅ Good:

List populates.
⚠️ Improvements:

None.
❌ Bugs:

💡 Suggestions:

Fix backend handler for lead status updates.
7️⃣ Tasks
Context: http://localhost:5175/crm/tasks

Findings: ✅ Good:

Creation works perfectly.
"Mark as Done" works and visuals update (Grey -> Black).
⚠️ Improvements:

💡 Suggestions:

Add a delete/archive icon.
8️⃣ General UX/UI
Summary:

Visuals: Excellent. Clean, modern, "Premium" feel.
Performance: Very fast (SPA feel), except when backend 500s occur.
Usability: High potential, but broken navigation (Clients) and backend errors (Filters, Leads) make it unusable for daily work currently.
9️⃣ Real World Simulation (Manager Alexey)
Scenario: Processing 10-15 orders/day.

Can I work in this CRM? -> NO.

Why?

I cannot filter new orders ("Awaiting manager" crashes). BLOCKER.
I cannot see client details (Profile doesn't open). BLOCKER.
I cannot process leads (Status change crashes).
I cannot see bike photos (Images broken).
What I still need Telegram/Excel for:

Communication with customers (No integration).
Viewing actual bike photos (CRM images broken).
Keeping track of "Warning" clients (Can't see history).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Status: ❌ NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION Score: 4/10

The system looks beautiful and feels fast, but fundamental workflows are broken by server errors (500s) and UI disconnections (Client profiles). The "Order Checklist" - a complex feature - works perfectly, which is a great achievement. However, without working Filters, Client Profiles, and Lead Management, a manager cannot perform their daily duties.

Verdict: Fix the Top 3 Blockers immediately, and it will be a solid MVP.
